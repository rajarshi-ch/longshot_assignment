## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Features

- Responsive
- Ligt/Dark Mode
- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- All custom Ui elements
- Simple local React state management, without redux, mobx, or similar

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- Install [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it already.
- Clone this repository
- `npm run install-dependencies`
- `npm run dev` to start a quick development server
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc. Most early stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

Both Client and API are currently tested through [end-to-end Cypress tests](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone/tree/master/client/cypress/integration). That's good enough for a relatively simple application such as this, even if it was a real product. However, as the app grows in complexity, it might be wise to start writing additional unit/integration tests.
