## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

### Drawer Nav bar in mobileâ™¿

A lot of care has been taken to make the pages responsive, but the navbar menu currently dissapears in mobile device, which is the expected behaviour. And the next step would be to add a hamburger type buttonon the top right that opens up the nav menu

### Accessibility â™¿

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc. Most early stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.

### Unit/Integration tests ðŸ§ª

Both Client and API are currently tested through [end-to-end Cypress tests](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone/tree/master/client/cypress/integration). That's good enough for a relatively simple application such as this, even if it was a real product. However, as the app grows in complexity, it might be wise to start writing additional unit/integration tests.
